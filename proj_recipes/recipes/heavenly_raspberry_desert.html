    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Light-tasting and delicious! My mother's famous dessert recipe has completed many holiday meals and makes a stunning summery cake. This works beautifully with strawberries as well.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (9 inch) angel food cake</li>
        <li>2 (3 ounce) packages raspberry-flavoured gelatin mix (such as Jell-O)</li>
        <li>1 + 1/4 cups boiling water</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) package frozen raspberries in syrup, thawed and undrained</li>
        <li>1 pint heavy whipping cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Butter a 9-inch tube pan. Break angel food cake into chunks; set aside.</li>
        <li>Stir raspberry gelatin and boiling water together in a bowl until gelatin is dissolved; place gelatin in the refrigerator to cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Stir raspberries with syrup into gelatin.</li>
        <li>Beat cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer until soft peaks form; fold whipped cream into raspberry mixture.</li>
        <li>Pour about 1/4 cup of raspberry mixture into prepared pan. Place 1/3 of cake chunks into pan; pour 1/3 of remaining raspberry mixture over cake. Repeat layering with remaining ingredients, ending with the raspberry mixture. Chill in refrigerator until firm, about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>To remove from pan, center a serving plate over tube pan; invert.</li>
    </ol>
